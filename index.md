# Defining a Song’s Genre in Relation to its Lyrics

Songs are relatable and expressive forms of art that help connect people with the same taste of feeling. Most people like listening to particular genres which is why music platforms such as Spotify and YouTube Music have made significant efforts to classify similar songs so they could recommend the right songs to their users. Oftenly, they base their recommendations on song genres. Aside from musical attributes and features, the lyrics of a song can also help identify which genre/s it falls under. With this in mind, we got curious regarding that matter and wanted to explore **how we can define a song’s genre in relation to its lyrics.**

## Specific Research Questions

With that goal, we came up with 4 research questions 

1. What are the most commonly used words per genre? (exploratory) 
2. Which are the genres most commonly combined? (exploratory) 
3. What words make a song Pop? Ballad? Rock? Etc? (inferential) 
4. Which genres have similar lyrics? (inferential) 

## Data Collection

## Initial Explorations

Before working on answering the research questions, let's first look at some facts about the collected data by doing some exploratory data analysis. 

1. Number of songs per genre

Looking at the resulting graph, the number of songs of the genres are close to each other. Christian & Gospel has the highest number of songs with <> which is followed by Hip Hop/Rap with <>. Though we have only collected data from 6 genres, a combination of genres are also seen in the graph as there are multi-genre songs in the data. 

2. Average Length of Song Lyrics
3. Average Length of Song Lyrics per Genre
4. Average Length of Song Lyrics per Artist
